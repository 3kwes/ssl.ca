Release v0.3, 08-MAR-2016

    Updates from Eric Dey

    - Added handling for Subject Alternate Names as DNS host names and IPs.
    - Parameterized key bits; default 2048.
    - Parameterized hash algorithm; default SHA256.
    - Use /dev/urandom for entropy instead of static "random-bits" file. (1)
    - Changed from DES3 to AES256 to encrypt Root CA key.
    - Server key usage as: nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
    - All scripts changed to use BASH.
    - Miscellaneous script clean-ups.

Note 1: 
While /dev/urandom is probably okay for most sites, you may consider using
/dev/random for public certificate authorities. The disadvantage to using
/dev/random is that it may take your system a long time to generate enough
kernel entropy to complete the request. The /dev/urandom device will continue
to give decent entropy even after the kernel's entropy pool is depleted. Either
of these are devices most certainly preferable to using the original static
"random-bits" file that you may forget to change between operations.
